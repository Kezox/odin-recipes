<p class="intro">A delicious cake with lots of cheese!</p>
<p>Takes a bit more, but it's totally worth it!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>904g full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature.</li>
     <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
     <li>1 cup (240g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature.</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
     <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
   </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
   <li><strong>Block cream cheese:</strong> Four 8-ounce blocks of full-fat cream cheese 
     are the base of this cheesecake. That’s 2 pounds. Make sure you’re 
     buying the blocks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread. There’s 
     no diets allowed in cheesecake, so don’t pick up the reduced fat variety!</li>

   <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> 1 cup. Not that much considering how many mouths you can feed with 
     this dessert. Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. Using 
     only 1 cup of sugar gives this cheesecake the opportunity to balance tangy and 
     sweet, just as classic cheesecake should taste.</li>

   <li><strong>A little flavor:</strong> 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice. 
     The lemon juice brightens up the cheesecake’s overall flavor and vanilla is 
     always a good idea.</li>  
 </ol>
